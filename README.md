## Getting Started
Clone this repository to use a local LaTeX installation or use an online environment like www.overleaf.com to create your own Vaesen hoebrew.

### Use Lua(La)TeX or Xe(La)TeX
The document class must be compiled using LuaTeX or XeTeX for some of the packages, like `fontspec`, to work.
